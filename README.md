# User Stories

    Using a kanban board i am going to use Agile development to work one user story at a time.

    - As an Admin I can go to inquiries so that I can fullfill users inquiries
    - As an Admin I can disable a user so that I can prevent users from accessing the page after they have broken a terms of service
    - As an admin I can create product post, set price, upload image (epic) so that	I can sell my products
    - As a User I Can look at the gallery so that I can browse for designs
    - As a User I Can add an item to my shopping cart so that I can buy can see the price combined and buy them all in one go
    - As a User I Can add an inquiry so that I can buy graphic design that fits my purpose
    - As a User I Can subscribe to the gallery so I can be notified when new art is being posted
    - As a User I Can go to purchase history so that i can watch the status on my inquiry
    - As a User I Can change my profile To keep my contact details updated
    - As a User I Can order(filter) the products so that I can more easily find what I need
    - As a User I Can make an account so that I can have the benefits

# Deployment

## via Heroku

- Before you deploy, ensure your requirements.txt is updated and accounted for and get your API keys ready.

- to deploy an application through Heroku, you need to make an account. Once you have created an account, you can have up to 5 projects on the free plan.

- To create a new app. Log in, and you'll see a "Create app" button.
  Once pressed, you'll be able to name your project and choose which region your application will host. The name needs to be unique.

- You'll need to set up all your setting before you can deploy your project. You can find the “setting” in the tabs in the dashboard.

  If you have API keys, you can insert them in the Config Vars section, and there is a button to reveal the keys.
  once clicked, the const you used in the project should be in "KEY" and creds.json in the "VALUE"

  Next, we'll set up build packs. Press the build pack and add the build packs you need. If you need more than one, make sure you put them in the correct order, You can drag and drop their list items.

- now, we can start the deployment by heading over to the deploy tab. in this project, I chose to deploy through GitHub.

  After I clicked through GitHub, I had to connect Heroku to my GitHub account. Thereafter I had to search for my project. Once selected.
  I could choose which branch.

  Now I can select an automatic deployment, which updates the app once GitHub updates or manual deployment that will only update Heroku when I press that button again.

  Now we'll wait for Heroku to download all plugins and install all the requirements. Once done, there will be a message telling it completed or failed. Once successful, it will show a button to view your deployed application.

- Now you have your deployed page. Now you can test if everything works as it should or send the links to your friends to show off those accomplishments you have made.
